    "[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), often shortened to EDA, is a term that you'll hear quite a bit in the field of data science. EDA is the process of examining a dataset to find facts about the data and communicating those facts, often through visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explore the data and visualize it, some modifications might need to be made to the data along the way. This is often referred to as *data preprocessing*. Though data preprocessing is technically different from EDA, EDA often exposes problems with the data that need to be fixed in order to continue exploring. Because of this tight coupling, we'll clean the data as necessary to help understand the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the [Kaggle page for the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings), we can find some basic information about the dataset. For instance, there are over 1,700 chocolate bars that have been rated. We can also preview the columns found in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Column | Data Type | Description\n",
    "-------|-----------|-------------\n",
    "Company (Maker-if known) | String | Name of the company manufacturing the bar.\n",
    "Specific Bean Origin or Bar Name | String | The specific geo-region of origin for the bar.\n",
    "REF | Number | A value linked to when the review was entered in the database. Higher = more recent.\n",
    "Review Date | Number | Date of publication of the review.\n",
    "Cocoa Percent | String | Cocoa percentage (darkness) of the chocolate bar being reviewed.\n",
    "Company Location | String | Manufacturer base country.\n",
    "Rating | Number | Expert rating for the bar.\n",
    "BeanType | String | The variety (breed) of bean used, if provided.\n",
    "Broad Bean Origin | String | The broad geo-region of origin for the bean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting dataset. Think of the questions that you might be able to answer! A few could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Is there a relationship between numeric rating and properties such as percentage of cocoa, bean type, origin, and maker?\n",
    "*   Are some of the properties of cacao beans correlated?\n",
    "*   Where are the top chocolate bars from?\n",
    "*   Are there multiple entries for the same bar from the same maker, but with different ratings over the years? If so, has there been any change in the chocolate bar that could account for the differences?\n",
    "*   Do makers who produce a wide variety of bars have a higher chance of creating a top-rated chocolate bar?\n",
    "\n",
